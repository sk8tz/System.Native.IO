Version 2.0
-----------
* New: The public key of AlphaFS.dll has changed, delay-signing is no longer used.
* New: Unit Tests, also act as code samples.
* New: Numerous bugfixes, optimizations and (AlphaFS) overloaded methods implementations.
* New: Complete implementation of .NET 4.5 File(Info) and Directory(Info) classes.
* New: Complete implementation of .NET 4.5 DriveInfo() class and with UNC support.
* New: Complete implementation of .NET 4.5 Path() class.
* New: Implemented Unicode aka "Long Path" handling for all Win32 API functions that support it.
* New: Added support for NuGet.
* New: Added support for building against .NET 4.0, 4.5, and 4.5.1 in addition to 3.5.
* New: Supports networking by enumerating hosts and shares (SMB/DFS) and connect/disconnect to/from network resources (AlphaFS.Network.Host() class).
* New: Supports working with NTFS ADS (Alternate Data Streams) on files and folders (AlphaFS.FileSystem.AlternateDataStreamInfo() class).
* New: Supports enumerating connected PnP devices (AlphaFS.FileSystem.Device() / AlphaFS.FileSystem.DeviceInfo() classes).

* New: Supports PathFormat parameter for numerous methods to control path normalization. This speeds up things internally (less string processing and GetFullPath() calls) and also enables working with files and folders with a trailing dot or space:
	* `RelativePath` (slow): (default) Path will be checked and resolved to an absolute path. Unicode prefix is applied.
	* `FullPath`  (fast): Path is an absolute path. Unicode prefix is applied.
	* `LongFullPath`  (fastest): Path is already an absolute path with Unicode prefix. Use as is.
* Mod: Enabled KernelTransaction parameter for all Win32 API functions that support it.
